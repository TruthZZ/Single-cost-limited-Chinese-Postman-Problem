# Single-cost-limited-Chinese-Postman-Problem
A Python implementation for Chinese Postman Problem with a limitation on the length of a single route based on heuristic algorithm

The two csv files are the input data of the nodes and roads:
nodes.csv records the longtitude, latitude and the serialnumber of the nodes;
distance is represents the approximate length of the roads betwween nodes and is recorded in the form of matrix. The distance should be zero where there is no roads between nodes.
